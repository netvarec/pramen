# pramen

Reactive backend runtime for TypeScript on **Cloudflare**. Define schema +
handlers, get a backend deployed as a Worker + Durable Object — the platform
provides the single-writer/storage/replication stack. Read `DESIGN.md` for the
architecture.

## WIP — everything is subject to change

Active development; nothing is stable. No backward-compat constraints — redesign
freely rather than patching around something that feels wrong. No preexisting
issues: if something is broken, fix it.

## Layout & architecture

The runtime is the publishable **`@pramen/server`** package at `packages/server/src/`
(SDK + Cloudflare glue). A project (see `example/`) is just `app.ts` + `oblaka.ts` +
a 3-line `worker.ts` that calls `createPramen(app)`.

```
example/worker.ts  createPramen(app) -> { fetch, PramenDO }
  Worker (fetch)  ->  PramenDO (per-tenant Durable Object)
                        ├─ ctx.storage.sql   in-process SQLite (the DB)
                        ├─ schemaDDL on boot (blockConcurrencyWhile)
                        └─ dispatch: query -> run; mutation -> storage.transaction()
```

- **`@pramen/server`** (`.` export) is authoring-only — `Entity`/`defineSchema`,
  `createApp`, `query`/`mutation`, ACL, files, errors, the substrate seam. The
  **deploy** half — `createPramen` + the Durable Object — is **`@pramen/server/worker`**,
  split off because only it imports `cloudflare:workers`. So the CLI/tests/codegen
  can load an `app.ts` for its schema without dragging in the DO runtime.
- The DO + Worker are **parameterized by the app** (`pramenDO(app)` / `makeWorker(app)`),
  closed over by `createPramen` — no static app import in the runtime.
- **The DO is the database.** Single-writer serialization is free (a DO handles
  one request at a time), per-tenant via `idFromName`.
- **D1 is NOT the DO's write path** — it's over-RPC, not in-process; the DO's
  SQLite is its transactional store. D1 is instead available as a separate
  substrate via the Worker (`x-pramen-store: d1`) — see the Substrate seam below.
- **SDK (`packages/server/src/sdk/`) is platform-agnostic** — the portable product.
  `packages/server/src/runtime/` is the Cloudflare glue.

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun run dev          # lopata dev (Bun runtime; fast reload + /__dashboard); http://localhost:8787
bun run dev:wrangler # wrangler dev (miniflare) — workerd-parity check before deploy
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit (server + client + react)
bun run build        # tsc → dist (JS + .d.ts) for all 3 packages (for published Node consumers)
bun run deploy       # wrangler deploy
```

Prod config: secrets via `wrangler secret put` (AUTH_SECRET; FILES_SECRET ≥16 chars or
files fail closed). Destructive migrations are OFF unless `PRAMEN_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=true`
(local dev sets it on). Packages use conditional `exports`: the `development`/`bun`/
`workerd` conditions resolve to `src` (so in-repo typecheck/tests/dev/deploy need no
build), while published Node consumers fall through to `dist` (`default`/`types`).
tsconfigs set `customConditions: ["development"]`.

Local dev runs on **lopata** (Bun-based CF runtime; fully emulates DO SQLite +
WebSocket Hibernation). It reads the oblaka-generated `wrangler.jsonc` unchanged and
serves a dashboard at `/__dashboard`. The e2e suite still boots real `wrangler dev`
(miniflare); run `bun run dev:wrangler` once before deploying to catch any
Bun-vs-workerd differences.

> pramen uses the published **lopata `^0.19.2`** from npm. It carries the two fixes
> pramen relies on: the proxy-to-DO deadlock (the canonical
> `stub.fetch(new Request(request, { headers }))` tripped a Bun `new Request(req)`
> stream-body clone bug) and DO SQLite surfacing `RETURNING` rows from `exec()`.
> `bunfig.toml` exempts lopata from a global `minimumReleaseAge` so a fresh lopata
> release installs immediately (other deps still honor the policy).

## Substrate seam (Driver/Dialect)

The data layer runs over a `Driver` (async `exec` + `transaction`) + `Dialect`
(`packages/server/src/runtime/driver.ts`), so the ACL/read/write engine is substrate-agnostic:

- **`DoSqliteDriver`** — the DO's in-process SQLite (the default write path).
- **`D1Driver`** — the SAME engine over a real D1 binding, run **in the Worker**
  (no DO) and selected per-request with the `x-pramen-store: d1` header. RPC only —
  live queries need the DO (single writer + socket host). Proven end-to-end in
  miniflare by `test/suites/d1.ts` (ACL, row scope, field/cell-level projection,
  RETURNING writes, aggregates). The D1 binding is declared in `oblaka.ts`.
- **`postgresDialect`** — shows the SQL shape for a future Hyperdrive/Postgres port
  (quoting + `$n` placeholders); needs a pg `Driver` over Hyperdrive.

## File storage (R2)

Files live in **R2**, not the DB. A `fileRef` column (`t.fileRef()`) stores only
JSON metadata (`FileRef`: `{ key, size, contentType, filename?, uploadedAt? }`) in a
TEXT cell — the bytes are an R2 object addressed by a tenant-scoped key. The object
store is behind a `StorageAdapter` seam (`R2Adapter`/`MemoryAdapter` in
`runtime/storage.ts`), mirroring the Driver/Dialect seam.

- Handlers use **`ctx.files`** — never the R2 binding directly:
  - `signUpload({ contentType, filename?, maxSize?, prefix? })` → `{ url, ref }` (a
    signed PUT url + draft metadata to attach later).
  - `signDownload(ref, { download? })` → `{ url, expiresAt }` — mint ONLY after an
    ACL'd `ctx.db` read; knowing a key is not authorization.
  - `head(key)` / `delete(key)` for upload-verify and cascade.
- The Worker serves `/files/upload` (PUT) + `/files/download` (GET), authorized by an
  HMAC token (`FILES_SECRET`, falls back to `AUTH_SECRET`) in the url. Bytes stream
  in the Worker — they never pass through the DO. Signed urls are RELATIVE; the
  client resolves them (`@pramen/client` `fileUrl()`/`upload()`).
- The object↔JSON codec lives at the `Db` chokepoint, so handlers always see/write
  `FileRef` objects. R2 is declared in `oblaka.ts` (`FILES` binding).

The same shape (adapter + `ctx.<service>` facade + Worker glue) is how other
Cloudflare services should be added (e.g. email via the Send service as `ctx.mail`).

## Partitions

An entity may declare a **`partition`** — the Durable Object class it lives in:
`Entity(t => ({...}), undefined, { partition: "audit" })`. The default is a single
partition (`"default"`), i.e. **one DO per tenant** — the original model. Partitioning
splits a tenant's data across multiple DOs (e.g. a hot path vs. an append-only audit
log) for independent single-writer serialization and storage.

- A partition-DO **only sees its own partition's tables**: migrate/admin/CLI are all
  **per-partition** — each partition is migrated, hashed (`schema_hash:<partition>` in
  `_pramen_meta`), and reported independently. `sdk/schema.ts` provides
  `partitionsOf(schema)` / `entitiesInPartition(schema, p)` / `partitionOf(schema, e)`
  / `DEFAULT_PARTITION` to enumerate/resolve them; `validateSchema(schema)` enforces the
  static invariants (relation targets exist; no relation crosses a partition).
- **Cross-partition relations, `with` eager-loads, and transactions are rejected** — a
  DO can't reach into another DO's SQLite. A relation whose source and target are in
  different partitions fails `validateSchema` at boot (and codegen). Keep related
  entities in the same partition.
- **Backward-compat invariant — DO NOT break:** the default partition uses the **bare**
  DO key `idFromName(tenant)` (NOT `idFromName(tenant:default)`), so a pre-partitions
  store is byte-for-byte the same DO. `partitionDoName(tenant, partition)` in
  `runtime/registry.ts` encodes this: bare `tenant` for `"default"`, `${tenant}:${partition}`
  otherwise. Routing and the tenant registry both go through it, so they stay in lockstep —
  any future change to DO addressing must preserve the bare-key form for the default partition.
- Admin/CLI address one partition at a time: `/admin/schema?tenant=&partition=` returns
  that partition's applied schema; `/tenants` returns `{ tenant, partition }[]`. The CLI's
  `schema status` loops `partitionsOf(app.schema)`, fetching + comparing each partition
  (a single-partition app reads identically to before).

## Conventions

- Schema: `Entity(t => ({ id: t.id(), ... }))` + `defineSchema({ table: Entity })`.
  Field builders: `id`/`textId`/`text`/`int`/`real`/`bool`/`json`/`fileRef`/`uuid`. `json`
  and `fileRef` are stored as TEXT and object↔JSON-codec'd at the `Db` chokepoint —
  handlers read/write the parsed value (a `JsonValue` / `FileRef`). `uuid` is a TEXT
  column typed as `string`; a supplied value is validated (`isValidUuid`) on write and
  rejected (400) if malformed. Modifiers are wrapper helpers (compose like
  `renamedFrom`): `notNull()`, `unique()`, `indexed()`, `defaultTo(v)`, `primaryKey()`,
  `generated()`, `hidden()` — e.g. `code: unique(t.text())`, `status: defaultTo(t.text(), "pending")`.
  `hidden()` marks a column never-readable through the ORM (stripped from every read
  projection — find/get, mutation echoes, relation loads, SYSTEM-mode `/admin/data` —
  even under `allow()`/SYSTEM; still writable + visible to raw `ctx.db.exec`). For
  secrets like a password hash. `primaryKey()` marks any column the PK (implies NOT NULL); `generated()` auto-mints a
  uuid on insert via `crypto.randomUUID()` (uuid-only) and makes the column optional on
  insert. The canonical UUID primary key is `id: primaryKey(generated(t.uuid()))`.
  `defaultTo` also takes a SQL-expression default via the `expr` helper — `expr.now()`
  (current UTC timestamp as TEXT, like `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`) or `expr.raw(sql)` — emitted
  unquoted and parenthesized (`DEFAULT (datetime('now'))`), e.g.
  `createdAt: defaultTo(t.text(), expr.now())`. Expr-default columns are optional on
  insert (the DB fills them); adding one to an existing table triggers a table rebuild
  (SQLite forbids `ALTER ADD COLUMN` with a non-constant default), which is additive
  (backfills existing rows) and ungated.
- Auth/ACL: an unauthenticated caller is the `anonymous` role (define it for public
  reads/writes; absent ⇒ deny). A policy `where` may use `$identity("path")` (caller)
  or `$input("path")` (request input — a capability/by-unguessable-key read). Public,
  pre-auth routes go in `app.routes` (matched before auth; use `ctx.callPrivileged`
  to forward a privileged mutation into the DO) — for signature-authed webhooks.
- Per-handler call authorization (the ACL only gates `ctx.db`): `query(fn, { auth })` /
  `mutation(fn, { auth })` where `auth` is `"authenticated"` | `string[]` (one-of role) |
  `(identity) => boolean`, enforced in `runtime/dispatch.ts` BEFORE the handler runs
  (throws 403). Gate any handler that touches `ctx.kv`/`ctx.env`/`ctx.mail`/`ctx.tasks`
  directly — those bypass the row-ACL, so un-gated they're callable by anyone. Absent ⇒
  open. `authorizeHandler(auth, identity)` is the pure check. `createApp` forwards `auth`.
- `@pramen/auth` (optional, verify-only core stays BYO-IdP): `authSchema` + `authHandlers`
  (`signup`/`login`/`me`, PBKDF2, server-assigned roles, HS256 tokens via `AUTH_SECRET`).
  `auth_users` columns: `username` (PK = JWT `sub`), `passwordHash` (`hidden()`), `roles`,
  unique mutable `email`, `active` (deactivation flag — blocks login). Also:
  `createMagicLinkAuth({ sendEmail })` (passwordless one-time links; transport is the
  app's — Cloudflare Email Sending via the `send_email`/`EMAIL` binding declared in
  `oblaka.ts`; magic-link users keyed on the immutable `username`, never the mutable
  `email`); and `createUserHandlers({ table })` + `authPolicies({ table, prefix, adminReadFields, … })`
  for ACL-gated admin (`listUsers`/`setUserRoles`/`setUserActive`/`deleteUser`) + self
  (`changeEmail`/`changePassword`) management — over `auth_users` or your own
  authSchema-shaped table. Session TTL via `AUTH_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` (role/active
  changes take effect on next login — no session store).
- Relations: `belongsTo(target, column)` / `hasMany(target, column)`,
  `oneHasOne(target, column)` / `oneHasOneInverse(target, column)` (single-valued 1:1 —
  mark the FK column `unique()` for the DB guarantee), and
  `manyToMany(target, { through, sourceColumn, targetColumn })` (**logical**: an **explicit
  junction entity** you write to directly — `ctx.db.insert(through, …)` to link, `delete` to
  unlink; no synthetic tables/write API). All must keep source/junction/target in one partition.
- **Real foreign keys** are **opt-in** on an owning relation via `onDelete`:
  `belongsTo(target, column, { onDelete: "cascade" | "setNull" | "restrict" })` (also
  `oneHasOne`) emits a `FOREIGN KEY … REFERENCES … ON DELETE` enforced by the engine on
  both DO and D1 (cascade/set-null/restrict + insert integrity). Without `onDelete` a
  relation stays logical (no constraint, no migration). Adding/changing an FK is a table
  rebuild (SQLite can't ALTER it): deferred on the DO's boot transaction, and via the D1
  driver's atomic `batch()` on D1; an FK over orphaned data is skipped + reported, not fatal.
- `where` can traverse relations: `{ owner: { name: "x" } }` (belongsTo/hasMany) or
  `{ tags: { name: "x" } }` (manyToMany, via a nested subquery through the junction)
  compiles to a subquery in both user queries and policy `where`; `with: { tags: true }`
  eager-loads the target list through the junction. The related entity's read scope is
  AND-merged (traversal can't widen access; an unreadable target drops out). Cell-`when`
  predicates stay single-table.
- `where` string ops: `like` (raw `%`/`_` wildcards) plus `contains`/`startsWith`/`endsWith`
  (auto-escape the needle so `%`/`_` are literal; case-insensitive). `NOT: { … }` negates a
  nested clause; `AND`/`OR` take arrays. Composite uniqueness: `Entity(fields, relations,
  { unique: [["a","b"]] })` (a managed multi-column unique index); single-column stays `unique(t.x())`.
- Handlers: `query()` / `mutation()` from `@pramen/server`. Context is
  `{ db, kv, files, env, identity, tasks, mail, queue }`. Mutations are auto-wrapped in
  `storage.transaction()` by `runtime/dispatch.ts` (commit on return, rollback on
  throw) — do not write transaction control in handler code. Raw `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`
  via `sql.exec` is rejected by DO SQLite.
- Deferred side-effects (notification email, webhooks): `ctx.tasks.enqueue({ kind,
  payload, delayMs? })` writes to the `_pramen_outbox` table in the SAME transaction
  as the mutation (atomic), and `app.tasks[kind]` runs it after commit, off the write
  path — at-least-once with retry/backoff, dead-letter, and a `meta.id` idempotency key
  (`runtime/outbox.ts`). The DO self-drains via an alarm scheduled at the next due time;
  the D1/Worker store (no alarm) drains via a Cron Trigger (`createPramen().scheduled`)
  or `POST /admin/tasks/drain` (`x-pramen-store: d1`). Admin: `/admin/tasks/drain`,
  `/admin/tasks/list` (both stores). Concurrent drains claim disjoint batches.
- Declarative triggers: an entity may declare `triggers: [trigger({ task, on: { create?,
  update?: true | string[], delete? } })]` (3rd `Entity` arg). On a matching ORM write the
  `Db` write path auto-enqueues `task` (payload `{ entity, op, id, row }`) in the write's
  transaction — no `ctx.tasks.enqueue` in the handler. A field-filtered update fires only
  on an actual value CHANGE; `hidden()` columns are stripped from the payload; raw
  `ctx.db.exec` and task-handler writes (suppressTriggers) don't fire triggers (no
  cascade); `createPramen` rejects a trigger whose `task` has no `app.tasks` handler.
- Bootstrap (code-defined reference data): `app.bootstrap: BootstrapFn[]` runs once after
  schema migration on each boot (DO first-fetch / D1 isolate init) with a privileged system
  `Db` — converge code-declared reference data (content types, block types, roles, flags)
  into the store so a fresh/reprovisioned DB matches the repo, no manual seeding. Idempotent
  (upsert, don't blind-insert); a throw is logged, never fatal; DO path runs default-partition
  only. `@pramen/cms` ships `defineContentType`/`defineBlockType` + `cmsBootstrap({ blockTypes,
  contentTypes })` (upsert-by-slug) — see `example/app.ts`.
- Native queues: `ctx.queue.send(binding, body, { delaySeconds?, contentType? })` /
  `sendBatch(binding, msgs, opts?)` (`runtime/queue.ts`) — a facade + adapter seam (like
  `ctx.mail`) over **Cloudflare Queues**, distinct from `ctx.tasks` (NOT transactional with
  the write, but higher-throughput with platform batching/retry/DLQ and a cross-Worker
  consumer). Producer addressed by BINDING name; `createQueue` discovers any env binding
  with both `send`+`sendBatch`; an undeclared queue FAILS CLOSED (throws). Declare a
  `new Queue({ name, binding: "both", consumer })` in `oblaka.ts`. Consume via `app.queues`
  (keyed by queue NAME — env-prefixed remotely, matched leniently by `routeQueue`:
  exact→suffix→single-handler), dispatched by `createPramen().queue` (the CF
  `queue(batch,env)` entry; wire it next to `fetch`/`scheduled`). A consumer is
  Worker-level (no `ctx.db`): its ctx is `{ env, kv, mail, queue, callPrivileged }` — reach a
  tenant DO via `callPrivileged` (the message carries the tenant). Per-message ack on
  resolve / retry on throw; an unrouted batch is retried whole, never silently acked
  (`runtime/queue-consumer.ts`).
- Email: `ctx.mail.send({ to, subject, text/html, from?, replyTo? })` (`runtime/mail.ts`)
  — a facade + adapter seam (like `ctx.files`). Transport from env: `EMAIL` binding +
  `MAIL_FROM` → Cloudflare Email Sending (no API keys); `MAIL_CAPTURE=true` → capture to
  KV (`mail:<to>`, dev inbox); else `send` FAILS CLOSED (throws) so a misconfigured prod
  doesn't silently stash security emails. Built in dispatch + the task-drain contexts.
- `ctx.env` is the Worker/DO environment (bindings + vars + secrets), loosely typed —
  use it to call external services from handlers (`ctx.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY as string`).
- No raw SQL in handlers — go through `ctx.db` (`find` is compiled by
  `runtime/read-engine.ts`). `ctx.db.exec` is an escape hatch.
- `insert`/`update` echo the persisted row projected to the caller's readable fields
  ∪ the columns they wrote ∪ the PK — never leaks an unreadable field, never `{}`
  (a write-only caller still gets the generated id). `projectWrite` in `runtime/db.ts`.
- SQLite (DO) has no boolean type — booleans are stored as INTEGER 0/1; binding
  coercion lives in `runtime/db.ts` and `read-engine.ts`.
- CORS for browser clients is opt-in via the `CORS_ORIGINS` var (comma-separated
  origins or `*`); unset means same-origin only.

## DO SQLite

pramen runs on **Cloudflare DO SQLite** — its own engine, not stock sqlite3, so
don't assume sqlite3 C internals. Stick to the `SqlStorage` API
(`ctx.storage.sql.exec(sql, ...params)` → cursor `.toArray()`).
